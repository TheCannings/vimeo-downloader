vimeo-downloader
================

Python script to download a video from Vimeo to your computer.  This is
originally based on
[vimeo-downloader](https://github.com/johnteslade/vimeo-downloader), which in
turn is based on [Vimeo Downloader 0.3](http://ossguy.com/?p=841).

The script is based on hunting down [this issue](https://github.com/johnteslade/vimeo-downloader/issues/8)

The original author recommends using the [youtube-dl
tool](http://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/) which, despite the name, supports Vimeo
downloads.  This tool is available in pypi and in many Linux package
repositories.

Usage
-----

Run the following from the command line:

    ./vimeo_downloader.py 1084537
